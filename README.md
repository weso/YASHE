# YASHE
*YASHE* (Yet Another ShEx Editor) is a [Shape Expressions (ShEx)](http://shex.io/) editor which started as a fork of [*YASQE*](https://github.com/Triply-Dev/YASGUI.YASQE-deprecated) (which is based on SPARQL). 
This tool performs lexical and syntactic analysis of the content of the editor, thus offering the user a realtime syntactic error detector. It has features like: syntax highlighting, visual aid elements (tooltips) and
autocomplete mechanisms. 
In addition, it offers a simple way of integrating into other projects

## Install :floppy_disk:

### NPM
YASHE is registered as a node package as well, so you'll be able to use the node package manager to keep your version of YASHE up to date. ([YASHE NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yashe))
```
$ npm i yashe
```
### JsDelivr
The YASHE files are hosted via JsDelivr. This CDN is the easiest way to include YASHE in your website.

```html
<link href='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/yashe/dist/yashe.min.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'/>
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/yashe/dist/yashe.bundled.min.js'></script>
```

### Github
Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/weso/YASHE) to download the YASHE [.css](./dist/yashe.min.css) and [.js](./dist/yashe.bundled.min.js) files (find them in the dist directory).  

## Getting Started
You can initialize YASHE via its constructor, or via the command fromTextArea. Both return in instance of YASHE, from now on referred to as yashe (lowercase). Both function take as argument a config object (that can be null).
Main YASHE constructor. Pass a DOM element as argument to append the editor to, and (optionally) pass along config            settings. 
YASHE(parent: DOM-Element, settings: Object) → YASHE instance: yashe . 
[Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/mistermboy/pen/XWJpqdY)

```js
var yashe = YASHE(document.getElementById('domId'), {
  //Options
});
```

``


Initialize YASHE from an existing text area (see CodeMirror for more info)
YASHE.fromTextArea(textArea: DOM element, config: Object) → YASHE instance: yashe
[Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/mistermboy/pen/OJPWZWX)

```js
var yashe = YASHE.fromTextArea(document.getElementById('texAreaId'), {
  //Options
});
```
### React.js
This is a basic example about how to use YASHE in React.js using hooks:
```js
import React, {useState,useEffect,useRef} from 'react';
import YASHE from 'yashe';

function Editor() {

  const [yashe,setYashe] = useState(null);
  const divRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
    
        if (!yashe) {
            const options = {
                persistent:false,
                lineNumbers: true,
            }
            
            const y = YASHE(divRef.current,options);
        
            y.refresh();
            setYashe(y);           
          }
      }, [yashe]
    );
    return  (<div ref={divRef}/>);
}

export default Editor;
```


## Configuration
This configuration object is accessible/changeable via YASHE.defaults and yashe.options, and you can pass these along when initializing YASHE as well. Other than the configuration we describe here, check the CodeMirror documentation for even more options you can set, such as disabling line numbers, or changing keyboard shortcut keys.

```js
var yashe = YASHE(document.getElementById('domId'), {
  value:'Starting value of the editor',
  mode:'shex',
  theme:'wiki', //dark

### Event Handlers
`cm.on(type: string, func: (...args))`

Register an event handler for the given event type (a string) on the editor instance. There is also a CodeMirror.on(object, type, func) version that allows registering of events on any object.

```js
yashe.on('blur', function(yashe) {
 console.log('The editor has been unfocused!');
});
```

`cm.off(type: string, func: (...args))`

Remove an event handler on the editor instance. An equivalent CodeMirror.off(object, type, func) also exists.

```js
yashe.off('blur');
```
### Fire your own events
`CodeMirror.signal(target, name, args...)`
```js
Codemirror.signal(yashe,'myOwnEvent'args...);
```

## API
API methods accessible via the yashe instance ( check the [Codemirror Manual](https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#api) for more info:

```js
// Get query value from editor
yashe.getValue() → query: String

//Set query value in editor
yashe.setValue(query: String)

// Get the content of line n.
yashe.getLine(n: integer) → string

// Get the number of lines in the editor.
yashe.lineCount() → integer

// Get the number of first line in the editor. 
yashe.firstLine() → integer

// Get the number of last line in the editor. 
yashe.lastLine() → integer

// Get the currently selected code. 
// Optionally pass a line separator to put between the lines in the output. 
// When multiple selections are present, they are concatenated with instances 
// of lineSep in between.
yashe.getSelection(?lineSep: string) → string


// Replace the selection(s) with the given string. By default, the new selection 
// ends up after the inserted text. The optional select argument can be used to 
// change this—passing "around" will cause the new text to be selected, passing 
// "start" will collapse the selection to the start of the inserted text.
yashe.replaceSelection(replacement: string, ?select: string)

// Retrieve one end of the primary selection. start is an optional string indicating 
// which end of the selection to return. It may be "from", "to", "head" (the side of 
// the selection that moves when you press shift+arrow), or "anchor" (the fixed side 
// of the selection). Omitting the argument is the same as passing "head". A {line, ch} 
// object will be returned.
yashe.getCursor(?start: string) → {line, ch}

// Return true if any text is selected
yashe.somethingSelected() → boolean

// Set the cursor position. You can either pass a single {line, ch} object, or the line 
// and the character as two separate parameters. Will replace all selections with a single, 
// empty selection at the given position
yashe.setCursor(pos: {line, ch}|number, ?ch: number, ?options: object)

// Tells you whether the editor currently has focus.
yashe.hasFocus() → boolean

// Returns the start and end of the 'word' (the stretch of letters, whitespace, or 
// punctuation) at the given position.
yashe.findWordAt(pos: {line, ch}) → {anchor: {line, ch}, head: {line, ch}}


// Retrieves the current value of the given option for this editor instance.
yashe.getOption(option: string) → any

// Change the configuration of the editor. option should the name of an option, 
// and value should be a valid value for that option.
yashe.setOption(option: string, value: any)

// Retrieve the currently active document from an editor.
yashe.getDoc() → Doc

// Retrieve the editor associated with a document. May return null.
yashe.getEditor() → CodeMirror

// Undo one edit (if any undo events are stored).
yashe.undo()

// Redo one undone edit.
yashe.redo()

// Programmatically set the size of the editor (overriding the applicable CSS rules). 
// width and height can be either numbers (interpreted as pixels) or CSS units (e.g "100%"). 
// You can pass null for either of them to indicate that that dimension should not be changed.
yashe.setSize(width: number|string, height: number|string)

// Scroll the editor to a given (pixel) position. Both arguments may be left as null 
// or undefined to have no effect.
yashe.scrollTo(x: number, y: number)

// If your code does something to change the size of the editor element (window resizes 
// are already listened for), or unhides it, you should probably follow up by calling 
// this method to ensure CodeMirror is still looking as intended.
yashe.refresh()

//Retrieves information about the token the current mode found before the given 
// position (a {line, ch} object). The returned object has the following properties:
// start -> The character (on the given line) at which the token starts
// end -> The character at which the token ends.
// string->The token's string.
// type -> The token type the mode assigned to the token, such as "keyword" or 
//         "comment" (may also be null).
// state -> The mode's state at the end of this token.
yashe.getTokenAt(pos: {line, ch}, ?precise: boolean) → object

// Fetch defined prefixes
yashe.getDefinedPrefixes() → object:

// Add prefixes to the query. The prefixes are defined as 
// {"rdf: "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"}
yashe.addPrefixes(prefixes: object)

// Remove prefixes from query. The prefixes are defined as 
// {"rdf": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"}
yashe.removePrefixes(prefixes: object)

// Set size. Use null value to leave width or height unchanged. 
// To resize the editor to fit its content, see //http://codemirror.net/demo/resize.html
yashe.setSize(width: Number|string, height: Number|string)

// Enable an autocompleter with this name. Only makes sense if you've programatically 
// disabled this completer before, as a plugin is automatically enabled when registering it 
// (see this function)
yashe.enableCompleter(completerName: String)

// Disable an autocompleter with this name.
yashe.disableCompleter(completerName: String)

// Store bulk completions in memory as trie, and in localstorage as well (if enabled). 
// The argument should be a key from the //autocompletion settings
yashe.storeBulkCompletions(type: String)

// Collapsing prefixes if there are any. Use false to expand them.
yashe.collapsePrefixes(collapse: boolean)

```

## Statics
Static functions YASHE
```js
// Register an autocompleter in YASHE. This automatically enables the completer as well
YASHE.registerAutocompleter(name: String, autocompleter: function)

// When typing a shape, this shape is sometimes syntactically invalid, 
// causing the current tokens to be incorrect.
// This causes problem for autocompletion. http://bla might result in two tokens: http:// and bla. 
// We'll want to combine these
YASHE.getCompleteToken(doc: yashe, token: Object, cursor: Object) //→ token: Object

```

## Developing YASHE :construction:
Feel free to fork and develop this tool.  You can submit your
contributions as GitHub pull requests.  To develop *YASHE* locally:

* `npm install`
* `npm run dev` for local development

### Docker:
You can also deploy YASHE with Docker. The only important requirement is that you have Docker installed and running on your computer.
Then, you just need to follow these steps.

1. Download the latest version of the repository, either as a ZIP file or by cloning the master branch.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/weso/yashe
```

2. Then move to the docker folder from inside YASHE. For that:
```shell
cd yashe/docker
```

3. Build yashe image: `docker-compose build`.

4. Finally, execute `docker-compose up`. This will deploy the container and expose the port 4000.
